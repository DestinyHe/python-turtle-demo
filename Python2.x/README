Turtle graphics demo scripts 

These scripts use Python's new turtle module, which
is part of the standard library since Python 2.6

This bundle also contains a backport of the version
1.1 of the turtle module, that comes with Python 3.1
to Python 2.5 / 2.6. It contains a couple of new
methods/functions and two bugfixes related to screen
updating. (The bugs show up onlys in rare cases.).

A few of the scripts use features of this new version.

So:

(1) if you want to use the new turtle module with Python 2.5,

or

(2) if you use Python 2.6 and you want to use those new 
features or you want to avoid running into those bugs,

replace the turtle module present in your version (in
Lib/lib-tk) by the one contained in this bundle.
